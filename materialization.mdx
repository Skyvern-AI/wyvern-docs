## What is feature materialization

Feature materialization is the process of pushing your offline features into online store like redis, which is close to your Wyvern application so that getting feature data during a production request is done with little latency.

You can leverage `feast materialize` for your materialization process or the `/feature/materialize` API if you're using Wyvern Feature Store.

[Wyvern Cloud](https://www.wyvern.ai) supports auto feature materialization which ensures materialization happens within 5 mins after new feature data lands on your offline store. This would keep your keep your feature data in your online store as fresh as possible.
