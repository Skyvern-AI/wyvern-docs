## Set Up Pipeline

A Wyvern pipeline is the API route that defines the logistics of your ML application pipeline and it defines the API endpoint of yours. There are three inputs:

- request schema: the MyRankingRequest we defined in pipelines/product_ranking/schemas.py
- response schema: the default RankingResponse
- the machine learning model: the RankingModel we defined in pipelines/product_ranking/models.py

Now let's define a PipelineComponent under `pipelines/product_ranking/ranking_pipeline.py`:

```python pipelines/product_ranking/ranking_pipeline.py
from wyvern.components.models.model_component import ModelComponent
from wyvern.components.ranking_pipeline import RankingPipeline, RankingResponse

from pipelines.product_ranking.models import RankingModel
from pipelines.product_ranking.schemas import MyRankingRequest, Product


class MyRankingPipeline(RankingPipeline[Product]):
    REQUEST_SCHEMA_CLASS = MyRankingRequest
    RESPONSE_SCHEMA_CLASS = RankingResponse

    def get_model(self) -> ModelComponent:
        return RankingModel()
```

## Register Pipelines

Similar to registering realtime features, register the pipeline with the Wyvern service in `pipelines/main.py`:

```python pipelines/main.py
from wyvern.service import WyvernService

from pipelines.product_ranking.ranking_pipeline import MyRankingPipeline
from pipelines.product_ranking.realtime_features import (
    RealtimeProductFeature,
    RealtimeProductQueryFeature,
)

app = WyvernService.generate_app(
    route_components=[MyRankingPipeline],
    realtime_feature_components=[RealtimeProductFeature, RealtimeProductQueryFeature],
)
```

To register the pipeline, pass the the route_components as a list, containing your pipelines, to `WyvernService.generate_app`. This basically register the /api/v1/ranking route in the Wyvern service.

Now if you do `wyvern run`, your ranking endpoint is ready to serve a request.
