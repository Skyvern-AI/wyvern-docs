## Wyvern Feature Serving

Wyvern Feature Serving currently integrates with the open source feature store, [feast](https://feast.dev/)

If you have already built your feast features, you can migrate over to your wyvern repository or create new feast code there:

1. Migrate/create your feast code, for example in `my-project/feature-store-python/features`.

2. Add the wyvern feature store code:

```python feature-store-python/features/main.py
from wyvern.feature_store.feature_server import generate_wyvern_store_app

# This import is required currently as Wyvern Feature store needs the real-time feature registry info
from pipelines.main import app as wyvern_app  # noqa: F401

app = generate_wyvern_store_app(path=".")
```

3. Run the wyvern feature service:

```shell
wyvern run --path feature-store-python.features.main:app
```
