## Wyvern Feature Serving

Wyvern Feature Serving currently integrates with the open source feature store, [feast](https://feast.dev/)

If you have already built your feast features, you can migrate over to your wyvern repository.

First, migrate your feast code to your repository, for example in `my-project/feature-store`.

Secondly, add the wyvern feature store code:

```python feature-store/main.py
from wyvern.feature_store.feature_server import generate_wyvern_store_app

# This import is required currently as Wyvern Feature store needs the real-time feature registry info
from pipelines.main import app as wyvern_app  # noqa: F401

app = generate_wyvern_store_app(path=".")
```

Lastly, run the wyvern feature service:

```shell
wyvern run --path feature-store.main:app
```
