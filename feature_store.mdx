Wyvern Feature Store currently is built on top of feast and provides the following responsibilities:

1. Defining a Feature Registry
2. Storing historic (date-stamped) feature data for model training
3. Materializing the latest feature data for real-time model inference

This interface returns a curated training feature dataset to use, which are wyvern request based.
