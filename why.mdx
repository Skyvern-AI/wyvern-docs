## Machine Learning Drives Huge Revenue Growth At Marketplaces

Every marketplace encounters common challenges that can greatly benefit from the application of Machine Learning (ML) solutions. These challenges encompass following areas

- product ranking
- recommendations
- fraud detection
- shipping cost estimation
- credit scoring

## ML Platform Is Hard To Build

From 2019 to 2022, we built two ML platforms from scratch both at Faire and Gopuff. We've also observed the wide usages of such a platform at a few others (Lyft, Patreon). We intimately understand the pain, substaintial costs and extensive efforts required to build a top-tier ML platform:

1. Latency constraints vary across use-cases
2. Input information needs to be shared across different functions (Fraud + Ranking, or Credit + Ranking)
3. Most companies rely on ad-hoc notebooks or pipelines to get moving, and start hitting a host of weird errors deploying it out, or making it scale
4. The cohesion is hard to form between the data team and the engineering team when it comes to building a ML application. 99% of data scientists rely heavily on enigneers to log data in production and build data pipeline to generate training data. It's very challenging to have a standard way to do it.

Before we started building such a system a few years ago, we explored multiple vendor solutions in the market for product ranking back then but couldn't find any solution that would empower the team to rapidly iterate on ML models tailored for our own business. We had so much unique business insights so having the control of the models was a no brainer. Therefore, building a ML platform in-house became the only solution.

Early in 2023, we talked to 40+ marketplaces, including top marketplaces in the world like Amazon, Etsy and Ebay, and learnt that their ML architecture are almost identical.

We believe there should be a ML platform for marketplaces and designed Wyvern with the following design principles:

1. give the control of the model to the marketplace
2. enable the Data team to move fast with minimum help from engineers: model training, connecting feature data to the model during inference, and productionizing the ML application effortlessly

## Boost The Productivity Of The Data Teams

Building a world-class ML platform isn't the core of any marketplace business. However, the actual model that contains the knowledge of all the unique insights for each marketplace is the core revenue driver.

The Data team, who build the ML model, and the Engineering team, who productionize ML pipeline, often work separately and have a "throw work across the wall" problem. We wanted to make data teams more independent, which greatly inspired us to build Wyvern. With Wyvern, data scientiests get easy access to iterate on features, models, DS-led retrieval, business logic and observability, which greatly help them move fast without the help from engineering.
