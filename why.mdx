## Every Marketplace Needs Machine Learning

Every marketplace encounters common challenges that can greatly benefit from the application of Machine Learning (ML) solutions. These challenges encompass areas such as product ranking, personalization, recommendations, fraud detection, shipping cost estimation, and credit scoring, among others.

## ML Platform Is Hard To Build

As the creators of Wyvern AI, we've gained valuable experiences working within renowned marketplaces, like Faire, Gopuff and Lyft, where we developed robust and scalable ML platforms that have played a pivotal role in driving rapid marketplace growth. We are a group of engineers who are so passionate about marketplaces. We intimately understand the pain, substaintial costs and extensive efforts required to build a top-tier ML platform.

## Every Marketplace deserves ML

From 2019 to 2022, we built two ML platforms from scratch both at Faire and Gopuff.

Before we started building, we explored multiple vendor solutions in the market for product ranking back then but couldn't find any solution that would empower the team to rapidly iterate on ML models tailored for our own business. We had so much unique business insights so having the control of the models was a no brainer. Therefore, building a ML platform in-house became the only solution.

Early in 2023, we talked to 40+ marketplaces, including top marketplaces in the world like Amazon, Etsy and Ebay, and learnt that their ML architecture are almost identical.

We believe there should be a ML platform for marketplaces and designed Wyvern with the following design principles:

1. give the control of the model to the marketplace
2. enable the Data team to move fast with minimum help from engineers: model training, connecting feature data to the model during inference, and productionizing the ML application effortlessly

## Boost The Productivity Of The Data Teams

Building a world-class ML platform isn't the core of any marketplace business. However, the actual model that contains the knowledge of all the unique insights for each marketplace is the core revevue driver.

For a team of 3 to 5 engineers, it usually takes about 5 to 8 months to build out an MVP platform and multiple years to scale out the infrastructure. Wyvern can bring the cost down to one-engineer week of work.
