## Why do we create Wyvern

All marketplaces face the same problems where ML comes in to help a lot: product ranking, personalization, recommendation, fraud detection, shipping cost estimation, credit validation, and so on.

We, the creators of Wyvern AI, personally all worked in well-known marketplaces where we built scalable ML platforms that help marketplaces grow crazily. We are a group of engineers who are so passionate about marketplaces. We understand how hard, how costly and how much work it takes to build a world class ML platform.

We create Wyvern to help every marketplace leverage a world-class ML platform just like what Amazon, Etsy, Ebay have, early on in their journey.
