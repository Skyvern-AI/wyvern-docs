## What is Wyvern Application

Wyvern is a machine learning platform that empowers data scientists to independently build and deploy production-grade machine learning pipelines for the e-commerce industry, reducing the engineering involvement in the entire process.

Wyvern's application is built to make it easy to serve your ML application to your production. It is built on top of [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) with lots of built-in Wyvern functionalities. It is a web framework that holds all the Wyvern ML pipelines and serves them through API.

## Define ML Pipeline

Let's think about the product ranking problem in a marketplace. Your marketplace has thousands or even millions of products and you're using elasticsearch or Algolia to do basic search. Now you want to build a ranking pipeline with Wyvern to superpower power your search with an additional ranking model.

Assuming your search (elasticsearch and algolia are pretty common search solutions nowadays) returns thousands of products. You would like to use your ranking model to guess what are the most relevant products related to the query and to what this particular user is looking for.

We're going to build a linear ranking model considering five factors:

- the search score of the product
- similarity between the query and the category of the product
- similarity between the query and the brand of the product
- similarity between the query and the title of the product
- similarity between the query and the description of the product

Here's the formula of the model:

```shell
model_score =
    2 * search_score
    + 10 * query_category_similarity
    + 20 * query_brand_similarity
    + 22 * query_title_similarity
    + 13 * query_description_similarity
```

What the pipeline does is to get all the features for each product and pass them to the model. As a result, the model returns the score of every product and the pipeline returns the list of ranked products.

## How to run

Let's see how to build the wyvern app:

```python pipelines/main.py
from wyvern.service import WyvernService

# the app is a fastapi application
app = WyvernService.generate_app()
```

The `app` is an fastapi app. You can run the application with [wyvern run](/cli#wyvern-run):

```shell
wyvern run --path pipelines.main:app
```

Output:

```
Running your ML application
INFO:     Started server process [17449]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Next, let's see how what is an Wyvern ML pipeline is.
