## Batch feature registry

Wyvern's batch feature registry is currently built on top of [feast](https://docs.feast.dev). If you're already using feast for your feature registry, you could migrate all the same code to integrate with wyvern.

## Real-time feature registry

Wyvern's realtime feature registry is supported through [the RealtimeFeatureComponent](/realtime_feature#wyvern-realtimefeaturecomponent).
