One main design goal of Wyvern is to define a standard way of how machine learning features are defined, retrieved and passed to models by Wyvern's framework. Once features are defined, Wyvern automates the whole retrieval process.

## Batch Feature Retrieval

Wyvern automates the retrieval of all the features required by your pipeline from feature store and store the features in memory per request. Inside every wyvern component, you can do `self.get_feature(identifier, "feature_name")` to get the feature value.

Next, let's see how realtime features are defined in Wyvern.
