Wyvern's configuration setting integrates with your environment variables or [.env](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=files-env-file) file automatically.

## Configure Environment Variables

Here's the list of default variables from the [settings reference](https://docs.wyvern.ai/sdk_ref#settings-objects).

You can set your environment variables by exporting them directly like this:

```
export REDIS_HOST=localhost
```

or setting them up in a `.env` file:

```
REDIS_HOST=localhost
```
