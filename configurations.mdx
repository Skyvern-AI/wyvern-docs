Wyvern's configuration setting integrates with your environment variables or [.env](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=files-env-file) file automatically.

Here's the list of default Configurations from wyvern's [Settings class](https://docs.wyvern.ai/sdk_ref#settings-objects).

There are two ways to configure Wyvern's settings:

1. Set your environment variables by exporting them directly to your environment:

```
export REDIS_HOST=localhost
```

2. Setting them up in a `.env` file:

```
REDIS_HOST=localhost
```
