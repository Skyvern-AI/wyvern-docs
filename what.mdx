Wyvern is a real-time machine learning platform for marketplaces, one that grows with the business.

Wyvern empowers data scientists to independently build and deploy production-grade machine learning pipelines for the e-commerce industry, reducing the engineering involvement in the entire process.

Wyvern starts with solving the Product Ranking use case, as it’s the ML model that brings the biggest impact to a growing marketplace as well as the most challenging problem. Most marketplaces builds in-house ML platform to solve the product ranking in the first place.

</Frame>

Wyvern is the orchestrator of your marketplace ML pipeline.

- connects your feature stores, model service and data warehouse
- provides feature logging in a consistent format as well as observability into your production ML application

Let's see what different colors mean in the architecture graph:

### The Red Areas: User Data

Wyvern indexes your product catalogs for fast real-time ML inference and connects to your data warehouse.

### The Organge Areas: Services

Services involved in ML lifecycle. Wyvern’s framework is designed to be agnostic to what these services are. Wyvern does provide out of the box solutions here in the organge areas.

#### Index:

This is where you index your real time features for fast feature look up. It could be elasticsearch index or redis, where you cache the fresh data of your product catalog

#### Feature Store:

Wyvern provides default feature store solution but is also able to connect to your feature store.

#### Model Service:

Wyvern connects to your model services.

#### Experimentation Service:

Wyvern connects to your feature flag and A/B testing tools
