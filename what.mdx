Wyvern is an opinionated framework to develop ML pipelines within marketplaces. Here's a list of features it enables:

- Making it easy to define features for your ML models
- Connecting to your retrieval engine (ie Elasticsearch, Algolia)
- Connecting to your feature store (ie Feast)
- Connecting to your model service
- Chaining multiple models
- Implementing custom business logic on top of the model output
- Productionizing your ML application
- Logging every important event in your ML pipeline, including real-time feature logging, model logging, business logic logging, impression logging, as well logging your own custom events.
- Generating training data set for model training
- Opentelemetry support (which is coming soon)
