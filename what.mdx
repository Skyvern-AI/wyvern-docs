Wyvern is a real-time machine learning platform for marketplaces.

With Wyvern, ML pipelines are modularized in a way to empower data scientists to independently build and deploy production-grade machine learning pipelines for marketplaces. As a result, Wyvern sets up the standards for the following that could be followed by every every ML pipeline building process:

- Setting up features for ML models
- Logging events
- Productionizing your ML application
- Monitoring your ML application
- Generating training data set for model training

Wyvern specializes bringing use cases like recommendations and rankings in-house fast.

</Frame>

Wyvern is your opinionated framework to deploy ML pipelines within marketplaces.

- Connects to your retrieval engine (ie Elasticsearch, Algolia)
- Connects to your feature store (ie Feast)
- Connects to your model service
- Allows you to define custom business logic
- Logs all the events in your ML pipeline, including real-time feature logging, model logging, business logic logging, impression logging, as well logging your own custom events.
- Opentelemetry support (which is coming soon)
