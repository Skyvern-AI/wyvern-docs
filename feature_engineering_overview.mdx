Wyvern's feature engineering solution is built on top of the open source feature store solution [feast](https://feast.dev/) and provides the following functionalities:

1. Feature registry
2. Online features: storing feature data in cache real-time model inference
3. Near real-time materialization: once your feature data shows up in your data warehouse, materialization happens right after and update the online feature store real-time model inference
4. Historical features: it provides get_historical_features interface, which not only covers offline features from the original features table but also covers the real-time features logged back to your data warehouse.

## Wyvern Feature Store

Similar to the Wyvern application, Wyvern Feature Store is also built with FastAPI. To run the feature store server:

```features/main.py
from wyvern import generate_wyvern_store_app

feature_store_app = generate_wyvern_store_app(path="path_to_feature_repo")
```

Now run:

```
uvicorn features.main:app
```

### APIs

#### oneline feature API

The default API path is `/feature/get-online-features`. You can also configure the path with the `WYVERN_ONLINE_FEATURES_PATH` environment var.

#### historical feature API

The default API path is `/feature/get-historical-features`. You can also configure the path with the `WYVERN_HISTORICAL_FEATURES_PATH` environment var.
