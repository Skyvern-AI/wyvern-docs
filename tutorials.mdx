## Install Wyvern
<CodeGroup>

```shell pip
pip install wyvern-ai
```

```shell poetry
poetry add wyvern-ai
```

</CodeGroup>

This will also install the [wyvern CLI](/references#wyvern-cli)

## Wyvern Application
Wyvern application (or Wyvern Service) is built with [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). Let's see how to build a Wyvern application like the one under `pipelines/main.py` in the boilerplate code:

```python pipelines/main.py
from wyvern.service import WyvernService

# the app is a fastapi application
app = WyvernService.generate_app()
```

Now you can run the application:
```shell
wyvern run --path pipelines.main:app
```
Output:
```
Running your ML application

INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## Design ML Pipeline
Let's think about the product ranking problem in a marketplace. Your marketplace has thousands or even millions of products and you're using elasticsearch or Algolia to do basic search. Now you want to build a ranking pipeline with Wyvern to superpower power your search with an additional ranking model.

Assuming your search (elasticsearch and algolia are pretty common search solutions nowadays) returns thousands of products. You would like to use your ranking model to guess what are the most relavant products related to the query and to what this particular user is looking for.

We're going to build a linear ranking model considering five factors:
- the search score of the product
- similarity between the query and the category of the product
- similarity between the query and the brand of the product
- similarity between the query and the title of the product
- similarity between the query and the description of the product

Here's the fomula of the model:
```shell
model_score = 2 * search_score + 10 * query_category_similarity + 20 * query_brand_similarity + 22 * query_title_similarity + 13 * query_description_similarity
```

What the pipeline does is to get all the features for each product and pass them to the model. As a result, the model returns the score of every product and the pipeline returns the list of ranked products.


## Define schema
Let's define the schema of the product and the schema of the ranking request:
```python pipelines/product_ranking/schemas.py
from wyvern.entities.identifier_entities import ProductEntity


class Product(ProductEntity):
    brand: str | None = None
    category: str | None = None
    categories: list[str] = []
    title: str | None = None
    description: str | None = None
    price: float | None = None
    number_in_stock: int | None = None
    search_score: float | None = None


class MyRankingRequest(RankingRequest[Product]):
    candidates: list[Product]
```
Here we're using the default RankingRequest with the Product entity we just defined. This actually translates to the following API request schema:
```json
{
  "user_page_size": 0,
  "user_page": 0,
  "candidate_page_size": 0,
  "candidate_page": 0,
  "request_id": "string",
  "include_events": false,
  "query": {
    "query": "string"
  },
  "candidates": [
    {
      "product_id": "string",
      "brand": "string",
      "category": "string",
      "categories": [],
      "title": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "price": 0,
      "number_in_stock": 0,
      "search_score": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

## Define Realtime Features
For a ML feature, there is usually an entity or a composite of entities that the feature is associated to.

Wyvern has the RealtimeFeatureComponent which allows you to inherit from and define the your feature group. It has three potential inputs: the primary entity, the secondary entity and the request entity.

In the ranking example, there are five features. For each feature, we need to define the entity of the feature.

The enity for the search score of the product is obviously the "product". Here's the definition for this feature:
```python pipelines/product_ranking/realtime_features.py
from wyvern.entities.feature_entities import FeatureData
from wyvern.components.features.realtime_features_component import (
    RealtimeFeatureComponent,
)
from wyvern.wyvern_typing import WyvernFeature


class RealtimeProductFeature(RealtimeFeatureComponent[Product, Any, Any]):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            output_feature_names={
                "search_score",
            },
        )

    async def compute_features(
        self,
        primary_entity: Product,
        request: Any,
    ) -> Optional[FeatureData]:
        features: dict[str, WyvernFeature] = {
            "search_score": primary_entity.search_score or 0.0,
        }

        return FeatureData(
            identifier=primary_entity.identifier,
            features=features,
        )
```

For the reset of features, they're all about similarity between the query and a product feature. This is what we call the "CompositeEntity" where the feature is the composite of two features of two different entities. Here's the definition of the composite feature group:

```python pipelines/product_ranking/realtime_features.py
from wyvern.entities.identifier_entities import QueryEntity


class RealtimeProductQueryFeature(
    RealtimeFeatureComponent[Product, QueryEntity, Any],
):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            output_feature_names={
                "search_score",
                "query_category_similarity",
                "query_brand_similarity",
                "query_title_similarity",
                "query_description_similarity",
            },
        )

    async def compute_composite_features(
        self,
        primary_entity: Product,
        secondary_entity: QueryEntity,
        request: Any,
    ) -> Optional[FeatureData]:
        # compute the potential categories for the query.
        # In another word, given a query, what are the possible categories
        #   that the query is referring to with top 3 probability.
        # For example, if the query is "iphone", the top 3 categories could be "iphone", "iphone case", "iphone charger"

        features: dict[str, WyvernFeature] = {
            "query_category_similarity": random.random(),
            "query_brand_similarity": random.random(),
            "query_title_similarity": random.random(),
            "query_description_similarity": random.random(),
        }

        return FeatureData(
            identifier=CompositeIdentifier(
                primary_entity.identifier,
                secondary_entity.identifier,
            ),
            features=features,
        )
```

## Register Realtime Features
Now we go back to the `pipelines/main.py` and register the realtime features with Wyvern service:
```python pipelines/main.py
from wyvern.service import WyvernService

from pipelines.product_ranking.realtime_features import (
    RealtimeProductFeature,
    RealtimeProductQueryFeature,
)

app = WyvernService.generate_app(
    realtime_feature_components=[RealtimeProductFeature, RealtimeProductQueryFeature],
)
```
To register realtime features, pass the realtime_feature_components, containing the list of your realtime features, to `WyvernService.generate_app`. This basically tells the Wyvern service that these are available realtime features ready.

## Define Model
```python pipelines/product_ranking/models.py
import asyncio
from functools import cached_property
from typing import List, Set

from wyvern.components.models.model_component import (
    ModelComponent,
    ModelInput,
    ModelOutput,
)
from wyvern.components.ranking_pipeline import RankingRequest
from wyvern.entities.identifier import CompositeIdentifier

from pipelines.product_ranking.schemas import Product


class RankingModel(
    ModelComponent[
        ModelInput[
            Product,
            RankingRequest[Product],
        ],
        ModelOutput[float],
    ],
):
    @cached_property
    def manifest_feature_names(self) -> Set[str]:
        return {
            "RealtimeProductFeature:search_score",
            "RealtimeProductQueryFeature:query_category_similarity",
            "RealtimeProductQueryFeature:query_brand_similarity",
            "RealtimeProductQueryFeature:query_title_similarity",
            "RealtimeProductQueryFeature:query_description_similarity",
        }

    async def batch_inference(
        self,
        request: RankingRequest[Product],
        entities: List[Product],
        **kwargs,
    ) -> List[float]:
        return await asyncio.gather(
            *[self._inference_helper(request, entity) for entity in entities]
        )

    async def _inference_helper(
        self,
        request: RankingRequest[Product],
        entity: Product,
    ) -> float:
        score = 0.0
        composite_identifier = CompositeIdentifier(
            primary_identifier=entity.identifier,
            secondary_identifier=request.query.identifier,
        )
        search_score = self.get_feature(
            entity.identifier,
            "RealtimeProductFeature:search_score",
        )
        query_category_similarity = self.get_feature(
            composite_identifier,
            "RealtimeProductQueryFeature:query_category_similarity",
        )
        query_brand_similarity = self.get_feature(
            composite_identifier,
            "RealtimeProductQueryFeature:query_brand_similarity",
        )
        query_title_similarity = self.get_feature(
            composite_identifier,
            "RealtimeProductQueryFeature:query_title_similarity",
        )
        query_description_similarity = self.get_feature(
            composite_identifier,
            "RealtimeProductQueryFeature:query_description_similarity",
        )
        if search_score:
            score += 2 * search_score
        if query_category_similarity:
            score += 10 * query_category_similarity
        if query_brand_similarity:
            score += 20 * query_brand_similarity
        if query_title_similarity:
            score += 22 * query_title_similarity
        if query_description_similarity:
            score += 13 * query_description_similarity

        return score
```

## Define Pipeline
A Wyvern pipeline is the API route that defines the logistics of your ML application pipeline and it defines the API endpoint of yours. There are three inputs:
- request schema: the MyRankingRequest we defined in pipelines/product_ranking/schemas.py
- response schema: the default RankingResponse
- the machine learning model: the RankingModel we defined in pipelines/product_ranking/models.py

Now let's define a PipelineComponent under `pipelines/product_ranking/ranking_pipeline.py`:
```python pipelines/product_ranking/ranking_pipeline.py
from wyvern.components.models.model_component import ModelComponent
from wyvern.components.ranking_pipeline import RankingPipeline, RankingResponse

from pipelines.product_ranking.models import RankingModel
from pipelines.product_ranking.schemas import MyRankingRequest, Product


class MyRankingPipeline(RankingPipeline[Product]):
    REQUEST_SCHEMA_CLASS = MyRankingRequest
    RESPONSE_SCHEMA_CLASS = RankingResponse

    def get_model(self) -> ModelComponent:
        return RankingModel()
```

## Register Pipelines
Similar to registering realtime features,  register the pipeline with the Wyvern service in `pipelines/main.py`:
```python pipelines/main.py
from wyvern.service import WyvernService

from pipelines.product_ranking.ranking_pipeline import MyRankingPipeline
from pipelines.product_ranking.realtime_features import (
    RealtimeProductFeature,
    RealtimeProductQueryFeature,
)

app = WyvernService.generate_app(
    route_components=[MyRankingPipeline],
    realtime_feature_components=[RealtimeProductFeature, RealtimeProductQueryFeature],
)
```
To register the pipeline, pass the the route_components as a list, containing your pipelines, to `WyvernService.generate_app`. This basically register the /api/v1/ranking route in the Wyvern service.

Now if you do `wyvern run`, your ranking endpoint is ready to serve.
