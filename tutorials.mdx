There are more explanations of what each component does. Each section builds on the previous ones but it is structured to separate topics so that you can go directly to any section and find information that you need'

## Install Wyvern
Please refer to the [Quickstart](/quickstart)

Initiate your wyvern repository with `wyvern init` which sets up boilerplate code for you.

## Wyvern Application
Wyvern application (or Wyvern Service) is built with [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). Let's see how to build a Wyvern application like the one under `pipelines/main.py` in the boilerplate code:

```python
from wyvern.service import WyvernService

# the app is a fastapi application
app = WyvernService.generate_app()
```

Now you can run the application:
```shell
wyvern run --path pipelines.main:app
```
Output:
```
Running your ML application
